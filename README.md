# Bug_Bounty_Organizer
This is a python script that helps in the first steps of a bug bounty, there is alot of file creation, and making sure things are in line, we also have to have to think about the future of our search and how it will look then.


This will organize a file structure tree of the domains and subdomains allowing you to easily locate and find the subdomains or domains, I am working on adding subdomain discovery.

My goal after that is basic fuzzing most likely of key hosts depending on regex terms

During these 2 I will also try to slip in subdomain take over checker, that way the script does the file structure needed, and some base scans, getting you all ready for a well organize hunt :)
